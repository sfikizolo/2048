2048 Game

This is a simple implementation of the 2048 game using Python and Pygame. The game board consists of a 4x4 grid, and the player must slide tiles around the board to combine tiles with the same number. The game is won when a tile with the number 2048 is created, and the game is lost when there are no more possible moves.

Usage

To play the 2048 game, simply run the 2048.py file. The game will load automatically, and you can start playing by using the arrow keys to slide the tiles around the board.
